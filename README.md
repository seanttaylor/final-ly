# Current.ly
Making the news feed personal again.

## Overview
Current.ly is a work-in-progress mobile web app that aggregates news from sources around the web including RSS feeds from high quality sites and platforms like Google Trends for real-time insights on what people are searching for around the internet.

The app also uses machine learning to tailor your feed over time while also leaving the option for chronological feeds. This is a simple lightweight alternative to bloated feed applications that never end. Just a decent news app with enough to keep you informed without driving you nuts.
