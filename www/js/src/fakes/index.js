Israel-Hamas: </strong>Hours before Trump departed for Riyadh, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/13/edan-alexander-release-secret-talks-bahbah\" target=\"_blank\">in between negotiating sessions</a> with Iran in Oman, his envoy Steve Witkoff secured a deal for the <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/12/hamas-releases-edan-alexander-last-living-american-hostage-in-gaza\" target=\"_blank\">release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander,</a> who had been in Hamas custody for 584 days.</p><ul><li>On Monday, Trump sent Witkoff and White House hostage envoy Adam Boehler to Doha to push for a broader hostage and ceasefire deal.</li><li>The stakes are high. Israel has vowed to undertake an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/05/israel-gaza-destroy-trump-deal\" target=\"_blank\">operation to occupy and flatten all of Gaza</a> if no deal is reached before Trump's trip ends. </li></ul><p><strong>3. Russia-Ukraine: </strong>Trump is pushing hard for the countries to hold direct talks this week for the first time in three year, even floating the idea of joining Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Turkey later this week.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/11/trump-putin-zelensky-peace-talks\" target=\"_blank\">Zelensky confirmed he'll travel</a> to Istanbul for the talks. Despite being the one to propose negotiations, Putin has yet to confirm his attendance.</li><li>Trump said Tuesday that he's sending Rubio, Witkoff and Ukraine envoy Keith Kellogg to Istanbul to help broker a ceasefire, and suggested Russia could face massive sanctions if they won't play ball.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Iran: </strong>Days after the conclusion of a fourth round of nuclear talks in Oman, Trump issued a public ultimatum urging Iran's leaders to accept a new nuclear deal or face a return to \"massive maximum pressure.\"</p><ul><li>\"I have never believed in having permanent enemies,\" Trump said in Riyadh, offering Iran \"an olive branch\" while stressing that the Islamic Republic can never have a nuclear weapon.</li><li>\"This is not an offer that will last forever. The time is right now for them to choose — we don't have much time,\" he warned.</li></ul><p><strong>Reality check: </strong>In Ukraine, Gaza and beyond, Trump's supreme confidence in his own dealmaking abilities hasn't yet been backed up by results.</p><ul><li>But bumps in the road might not stop him from declaring victory, as he did last week when a partial truce with the Houthis gave him cover to end an operation he'd begun to see as a costly boondoggle, the NYT <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/us/politics/trump-houthis-bombing.html\" target=\"_blank\">reports</a>.</li></ul><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Trump has branded his Middle East diplomacy as a repudiation of both neoconservative interventionism and liberal internationalism — and as proof that his transactional, \"America First\" approach is delivering where past U.S. presidents failed.</p><ul><li>He portrayed the Gulf region's transformation as the product of local ambition and authoritarian stability — not Western values or American-led nation-building.</li><li>\"The gleaming marbles of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi were not created by the so-called nation builders, neocons or liberal nonprofits, like those who spent trillions and trillions of dollars failing to develop Kabul, Baghdad, so many other cities,\" he said.</li><li>\"Instead, the birth of a modern Middle East has been brought by the people of the region themselves.\"</li></ul>",

                    "description": "<p>The White House's executive order to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/11/trump-drug-prices-executive-order-pharmaceuticals\" target=\"_blank\">lower drug prices</a> is largely an exercise in applying leverage, rather than actual policymaking — and it may not amount to much, experts said.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>President Trump says his directive will dramatically reduce drug costs for U.S. consumers, and quickly. But there are few details as to how he plans to accomplish that. </p><hr><ul><li>Instead, Trump appears to be adapting the playbook he's used on universities over Gaza protests: Threaten administrative actions that could be financially painful, set a deadline — in this case 30 days — and then see what happens. </li><li>\"It reminds us of how in President Trump's first term he was 'all bark, no bite' on drug pricing,\" Chris Meekins, an analyst at Raymond James, wrote in an investor note Monday.</li><li>\"We don't completely discount the possibility that the EO could eventually lead to some one-off deals, but the order itself is so vague that it's difficult to predict the exact impact it may have,\" Capital Alpha's Kim Monk wrote in a note.</li></ul><p><strong>State of play: </strong>The order calls for drugmakers to voluntarily cut prices or face the threat of a \"most favored nation\" pricing regime that would peg the cost of their medicines to what's paid in other wealthy nations, where they often sell for less.</p><ul><li>The timeline for the administration to actually secure lower drug prices is slippery. Trump posted on social media Sunday that American consumers would \"almost immediately\" see their drug prices fall by 30% to 80%.</li><li>In reality, it would take much longer than that. The executive order gives administration officials 30 days to come up with new target drug prices and to communicate them to companies. If the companies don't agree to lower prices voluntarily, Health and Human Services will kick off a rulemaking process and other enforcement actions — all of which take considerable amounts of time.</li><li>That includes actions such as certifying drug importations from other developed nations, increased antitrust enforcement and the potential modification or loss of drug approvals.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>The order is almost certain to be challenged in court, just like a similar most favored nation policy for Medicare was during Trump's first term.</p><ul><li>\"If people thought Harvard was well capitalized enough to fight back against Trump's lawsuits, wait until they see the drug industry,\" John Barkett, managing director at BRG and former senior policy adviser in the Biden White House.</li><li>Trump's 2020 attempt to tie Medicare Part B drugs to the lowest price paid by other OECD countries was blocked by a federal judge after the drug industry sued.  </li><li>This time, the administration may be hampered by last year's Supreme Court decision that struck down the so-called Chevron deference and could limit executive branch agencies' ability to compel drugmakers to cut prices without action from Congress.</li><li>Trump said during a press conference Monday that he spoke to the Republican leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives about passing legislation to lower drug prices. But government price negotiation has historically been very unpopular with Republican lawmakers. </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> The EO also calls for pushing other countries to increase what they pay for drugs to share the costs for biomedical innovation.</p><ul><li>It is unclear how the U.S. intends to push other countries to do that, although the economics would suggest that pushing prices down in the U.S. could drive up prices elsewhere, Yunan Ji, assistant professor of strategy in the business of health initiative at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business.</li><li>Most favored nation pricing generally works better for smaller economies, Ji said.<strong> </strong></li><li>\"When a really large economy factors prices against some smaller economies, that's going to affect the whole global equilibrium,\" Ji said. \"So it's not certain that the U.S. will actually save money. It could, but it's going to set off a whole lot of reshuffling because the European contracts will have to be renegotiated.\"</li></ul><p><strong>Reality check: </strong>The pharmaceutical industry doesn't seem excessively worried.</p><ul><li>\"The Administration is right to use trade negotiations to force foreign governments to pay their fair share for medicines.

                    "content:encoded": "<p>The White House's executive order to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/11/trump-drug-prices-executive-order-pharmaceuticals\" target=\"_blank\">lower drug prices</a> is largely an exercise in applying leverage, rather than actual policymaking — and it may not amount to much, experts said.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>President Trump says his directive will dramatically reduce drug costs for U.S. consumers, and quickly. But there are few details as to how he plans to accomplish that. </p><hr><ul><li>Instead, Trump appears to be adapting the playbook he's used on universities over Gaza protests: Threaten administrative actions that could be financially painful, set a deadline — in this case 30 days — and then see what happens. </li><li>\"It reminds us of how in President Trump's first term he was 'all bark, no bite' on drug pricing,\" Chris Meekins, an analyst at Raymond James, wrote in an investor note Monday.</li><li>\"We don't completely discount the possibility that the EO could eventually lead to some one-off deals, but the order itself is so vague that it's difficult to predict the exact impact it may have,\" Capital Alpha's Kim Monk wrote in a note.</li></ul><p><strong>State of play: </strong>The order calls for drugmakers to voluntarily cut prices or face the threat of a \"most favored nation\" pricing regime that would peg the cost of their medicines to what's paid in other wealthy nations, where they often sell for less.</p><ul><li>The timeline for the administration to actually secure lower drug prices is slippery. Trump posted on social media Sunday that American consumers would \"almost immediately\" see their drug prices fall by 30% to 80%.</li><li>In reality, it would take much longer than that. The executive order gives administration officials 30 days to come up with new target drug prices and to communicate them to companies. If the companies don't agree to lower prices voluntarily, Health and Human Services will kick off a rulemaking process and other enforcement actions — all of which take considerable amounts of time.</li><li>That includes actions such as certifying drug importations from other developed nations, increased antitrust enforcement and the potential modification or loss of drug approvals.</li></ul><p><strong>Yes, but: </strong>The order is almost certain to be challenged in court, just like a similar most favored nation policy for Medicare was during Trump's first term.</p><ul><li>\"If people thought Harvard was well capitalized enough to fight back against Trump's lawsuits, wait until they see the drug industry,\" John Barkett, managing director at BRG and former senior policy adviser in the Biden White House.</li><li>Trump's 2020 attempt to tie Medicare Part B drugs to the lowest price paid by other OECD countries was blocked by a federal judge after the drug industry sued.  </li><li>This time, the administration may be hampered by last year's Supreme Court decision that struck down the so-called Chevron deference and could limit executive branch agencies' ability to compel drugmakers to cut prices without action from Congress.</li><li>Trump said during a press conference Monday that he spoke to the Republican leaders of the Senate and the House of Representatives about passing legislation to lower drug prices. But government price negotiation has historically been very unpopular with Republican lawmakers. </li></ul><p><strong>Between the lines:</strong> The EO also calls for pushing other countries to increase what they pay for drugs to share the costs for biomedical innovation.</p><ul><li>It is unclear how the U.S. intends to push other countries to do that, although the economics would suggest that pushing prices down in the U.S. could drive up prices elsewhere, Yunan Ji, assistant professor of strategy in the business of health initiative at Georgetown's McDonough School of Business.</li><li>Most favored nation pricing generally works better for smaller economies, Ji said.<strong> </strong></li><li>\"When a really large economy factors prices against some smaller economies, that's going to affect the whole global equilibrium,\" Ji said. \"So it's not certain that the U.S. will actually save money. It could, but it's going to set off a whole lot of reshuffling because the European contracts will have to be renegotiated.\"</li></ul><p><strong>Reality check: </strong>The pharmaceutical industry doesn't seem excessively worried.</p><ul><li>\"The Administration is right to use trade negotiations to force foreign governments to pay their fair share for medicines. U.S. patients should not foot the bill for global innovation,\" PhRMA CEO and president Stephen Ubl said in a statement. </li><li>Still, industry leaders warned against the dangers of \"importing foreign price controls.\"</li></ul><p><strong>The intrigue: </strong>Given all the uncertainty, some are speculating the order may do little more than distract from the grinding Medicaid debate in Congress. </p><ul><li>\"At the end of the day, was this just a distraction to try to get reporters not to focus on GOP efforts to cut Medicaid?

'do you know this Roberto Prevost?'\" Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, said at a press conference alongside fellow North American cardinals.</li><li>The truth was Dolan knew very little about Prevost, who spent most of his adult life away from the U.S. — much of it as a missionary and later bishop in Peru, where he gained dual citizenship. </li><li>When the American cardinals posed for a photo ahead of the conclave, Prevost wasn't even in it.</li></ul><p><strong>There was a longstanding belief</strong> that an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/pope-origins-country-italy-argentina-empires-usa\" target=\"_blank\">American would never be selected pope</a>, because the U.S. is already a geopolitical superpower. </p><ul><li>But when it came to Prevost, the fact that he was an American was \"almost negligible in the deliberations of the conclave, surprisingly so for me,\" said Robert McElroy, the archbishop of Washington.</li></ul><img src=\"https://images.axios.com/0foVWHC1r0j_tN5X0OsyXZBXfD0=/2025/05/09/1746819682271.jpg\"> <div>The cardinals gather for the conclave. Photo: Francesco Sforza/Vatican Media/Getty Images</div><h2>Francis' heir, but his own man</h2><p><strong>Prevost only became a cardinal in 2023, </strong>but Pope Francis made him one of the senior-most figures in the Catholic hierarchy earlier this year by elevating him to the rank of cardinal-bishop.</p><ul><li>He was seen as close to his predecessor both personally and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/09/pope-leo-climate\" target=\"_blank\">in terms of outlook</a>, but somewhat more moderate in temperament and on some ideological questions than the more fiery Francis.</li><li>That made him a continuity candidate but also a plausibly acceptable choice for some who had quibbles with Francis.</li><li>The chatter among the electors ahead of the conclave was \"we're looking for someone following in the pathway of Francis, but we're not looking for a photocopy,\" McElroy said.</li></ul><h2>\"He runs a great meeting\"</h2><p><strong>Francis made Prevost </strong>the head of the powerful Curia department responsible for appointing bishops, bringing him into closer contact with senior figures in the church, including some who later elevated him to the papacy.</p><ul><li>Dolan said one of the first pieces of insight he picked up about Prevost was \"he runs a great meeting, which not everybody does.\" </li><li>Multiple cardinals said they saw Prevost as a good listener and an effective administrator, while others were impressed by their interactions with him ahead of the conclave.</li><li>\"It wasn't that he got up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed the body,\" reflected Cardinal Wilton Gregory. \"But I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\"</li></ul><img src=\"https://images.axios.com/b-x4OlevJMaoEvLAKnPmAm18q_w=/2025/05/09/1746819794344.jpg\"> <div>North American cardinals holding a press conference today.

                    "content:encoded": "<p>The Vatican's veil of secrecy is beginning to lift, shedding light on how 133 cardinals from around he world unexpectedly coalesced behind Chicago native Robert Prevost, now <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/pope-conclave-white-smoke-vatican\" target=\"_blank\">Pope Leo XIV</a>.</p><p><strong>The big picture: </strong>Prevost benefitted from being the \"least American\" of the U.S. cardinals, from being an acolyte of <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/pope-francis-will-vatican-release\" target=\"_blank\">Pope Francis'</a> but not a \"photocopy,\" and from his reputation as a good listener and quietly effective administrator, his fellow cardinals revealed on Friday.</p><hr><h2>The quiet American</h2><p><strong>Prevost was hardly mentioned</strong> in pre-conclave media coverage and was a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/robert-prevost-pope-prediction-markets\" target=\"_blank\">non-factor in the betting markets</a> — but he was the subject of intense interest among his fellow cardinals in the days between their arrival in Rome and the start of the conclave.</p><ul><li>\"I was surprised at how many of my colleagues asked me... 'do you know this Roberto Prevost?'\" Timothy Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, said at a press conference alongside fellow North American cardinals.</li><li>The truth was Dolan knew very little about Prevost, who spent most of his adult life away from the U.S. — much of it as a missionary and later bishop in Peru, where he gained dual citizenship. </li><li>When the American cardinals posed for a photo ahead of the conclave, Prevost wasn't even in it.</li></ul><p><strong>There was a longstanding belief</strong> that an <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/08/pope-origins-country-italy-argentina-empires-usa\" target=\"_blank\">American would never be selected pope</a>, because the U.S. is already a geopolitical superpower. </p><ul><li>But when it came to Prevost, the fact that he was an American was \"almost negligible in the deliberations of the conclave, surprisingly so for me,\" said Robert McElroy, the archbishop of Washington.</li></ul><img src=\"https://images.axios.com/0foVWHC1r0j_tN5X0OsyXZBXfD0=/2025/05/09/1746819682271.jpg\"> <div>The cardinals gather for the conclave. Photo: Francesco Sforza/Vatican Media/Getty Images</div><h2>Francis' heir, but his own man</h2><p><strong>Prevost only became a cardinal in 2023, </strong>but Pope Francis made him one of the senior-most figures in the Catholic hierarchy earlier this year by elevating him to the rank of cardinal-bishop.</p><ul><li>He was seen as close to his predecessor both personally and <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/05/09/pope-leo-climate\" target=\"_blank\">in terms of outlook</a>, but somewhat more moderate in temperament and on some ideological questions than the more fiery Francis.</li><li>That made him a continuity candidate but also a plausibly acceptable choice for some who had quibbles with Francis.</li><li>The chatter among the electors ahead of the conclave was \"we're looking for someone following in the pathway of Francis, but we're not looking for a photocopy,\" McElroy said.</li></ul><h2>\"He runs a great meeting\"</h2><p><strong>Francis made Prevost </strong>the head of the powerful Curia department responsible for appointing bishops, bringing him into closer contact with senior figures in the church, including some who later elevated him to the papacy.</p><ul><li>Dolan said one of the first pieces of insight he picked up about Prevost was \"he runs a great meeting, which not everybody does.\" </li><li>Multiple cardinals said they saw Prevost as a good listener and an effective administrator, while others were impressed by their interactions with him ahead of the conclave.</li><li>\"It wasn't that he got up and made this overwhelmingly convincing speech that just wowed the body,\" reflected Cardinal Wilton Gregory. \"But I do believe he engaged quite effectively in the smaller group conversations.\"</li></ul><img src=\"https://images.axios.com/b-x4OlevJMaoEvLAKnPmAm18q_w=/2025/05/09/1746819794344.jpg\"> <div>North American cardinals holding a press conference today.

Marjorie Taylor Greene would win a Republican primary but lose to Ossoff. One poll conducted by a Republican group shows her getting \"smoked,\" said one person who had reviewed the numbers.</p><ul><li>\"The president loves MTG. He doesn't love her chances in a general,\" the Trump adviser said.</li><li>Greene has not ruled out a race, but those familiar with her thinking say she's aware of the perception that she could not win a general election. They also note she's a more savvy operator than publicly perceived and knows how to read a poll.</li></ul><p>🔫 <strong>The race unofficially began</strong> Thursday morning when Republican Rep.
